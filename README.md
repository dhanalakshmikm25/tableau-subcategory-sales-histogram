## 📊 Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard provides a **marginal histogram analysis** of U.S. product sub-category sales from 2021 to 2024.  
It combines **time-series trends, regional mapping, and sub-category breakdowns** to show how different product lines perform over time.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Overall sales grew steadily after 2021, with visible peaks in late 2023 and early 2024.  
- **Furniture categories** (Chairs and Tables) lead in sales, surpassing $300 K, while **office supplies** such as Labels and Fasteners remain lowest.
